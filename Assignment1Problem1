#Assignment 1-Problem 1
#1. Create a JSON file (employee.json) containing employee information of minimum 5 employees. Each employee information consists of Name,
DOB, Height, City, State. Write a python program that reads this information from the JSON file and saves the information into a list of objects of Employee class.
Finally print the list of the Employee objects.

#CODE:

import json

class Employee:
    def _init_(self, name, dob, height, city, state):
        self.name = name
        self.dob = dob
        self.height = height
        self.city = city
        self.state = state

with open('employee.json') as file:
    data = json.load(file)

employee_list = []

for employee_data in data:
    name = employee_data['name']
    dob = employee_data['DOB']
    height = employee_data['Height']
    city = employee_data['City']
    state = employee_data['State']
